        <h3>Spider-Man: Across The Spiderverse</h3>

            <h4>By Sarah Mangin</h4>

                <p>Greatest movie i have ever seen</p>

                <p>Title: A Spectacular Web of Art and Adventure: Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse</p>

                <p>As a long-time Spider-Man enthusiast, I had high expectations for the much-anticipated sequel to the groundbreaking "Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse." 
                And boy, did "Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse" 
                swing beyond my wildest dreams! This animated masterpiece, directed by Joaquim Dos Santos and produced by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, 
                is a thrilling and visually stunning journey that takes us on a multiverse-spanning adventure with our friendly neighborhood Spider-People.</p>

                <p>The movie picks up where its predecessor left off, with Miles Morales embracing his role as Spider-Man. 
                However, this time, he finds himself hopping across different dimensions, meeting alternate versions of familiar characters and battling a new threat that could unravel the fabric of reality. 
                The plot is woven with precision, seamlessly blending action, humor, and heartfelt moments.</p>

                <p>One of the film's strongest assets is its exceptional animation. 
                Just like the first film, "Across the Spider-Verse" showcases a distinctive and innovative visual style. 
                The combination of traditional and computer-generated animation, bold colors, comic book aesthetics, and the mesmerizing use of dimension-hopping animation creates an immersive experience like no other. 
                The action sequences are breathtaking, full of dynamic and fluid movements that effortlessly transition between characters from different universes.</p>

                <p>The voice acting is top-notch, with Shameik Moore returning as the voice of Miles Morales and delivering an emotionally resonant performance. 
                Joining him are other talented actors like Hailee Steinfeld, Jake Johnson, and more, who all bring life to their respective characters with enthusiasm and authenticity.</p>

                <p>What sets "Across the Spider-Verse" apart is its exploration of the multi-dimensional aspect of the Spider-Verse. 
                Miles Morales' encounters with other Spider-People allow for fresh character dynamics and interactions. 
                We get to see different versions of iconic characters like Gwen Stacy (Spider-Woman/Spider-Gwen), Peter B. Parker, and even some surprises that I won't spoil here. 
                These interactions not only add depth to the narrative but also provide numerous laugh-out-loud moments.</p>   

                <p>Another commendable aspect is the film's emotional depth. Miles' struggles with the responsibility of being a hero and dealing with personal dilemmas are beautifully portrayed. 
                The movie doesn't shy away from exploring the complexities of friendship and loss, making it relatable and compelling for both young and adult audiences.</p>  

                <p>If I were to nitpick, I could say that some moments felt slightly rushed, particularly in the final act, where certain plot developments could have used a bit more time to breathe.
                However, the film's overall brilliance overshadows any minor flaws.</p>   

                <p>"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse" is not just a superhero movie; it's a visual spectacle and an emotional rollercoaster. 
                It seamlessly blends humor, heart, and action, creating a captivating web that will enthrall audiences from start to finish. 
                I can't wait to see how this ambitious and exhilarating story continues in the next installment. 
                If you are a Spider-Man fan or just a lover of fantastic animation, this film is an absolute must-see!</p>

        <h3>Godzilla: King of the Monsters</h3>

            <h4> by Zay'vion</h4>

                <p>Greatest monster movie created. Godzilla vs Gidora was a spectacular fight</p>

                <p>The sounds and the roars where spot on. Like yoru actually watching a beast in real time</p>

                <p>A problem with the movie is that they gave the humans too much screen time. Like we came to see monsters. Not any humans intervene</p>

                <p>I dont care about millie bobby brown and her damn daddy issues. I came to godzilla fight and see him spin the block</p>
